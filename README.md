## Features

- **Minimalistic Design**: Clean and modern interface to showcase academic work.
- **Markdown Support**: Write website content using markdown files.
- **Dark Mode**: Supports dark mode for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly.
- **Bib File Parsing**: Directly parse and display publications from `.bib` files.

## Customization

### Structure

Your data is divided into three parts:

- `public` folder: Stores your images and CV files.
- `data` folder: Stores your MDX files and `.bib` files.
- `website.config.js`: Contains your personal information and social media links.

### MDX

We use `.mdx` files to write content, which is an extension of markdown files. You can use markdown syntax to write your content.

### Project frontmatter

MDX files in the `data/projects` directory need to include frontmatter at the top in the following format:

```
---

title: "FibeRobo"

description: "Fabricating 4D Fiber Interfaces by Continuous Drawing of Temperature Tunable Liquid Crystal Elastomers"

date: "2023-01-01"

image: "/project1.jpg"

---
```

The image can be stored in the `public` folder.

## Bib Files

Place your .bib file in the `data/bib` directory. The application will automatically parse the file and display your publications. Make sure to name the `.bib` file as `Publications.bib` or `SelectedPublications.bib` for correct parsing.
